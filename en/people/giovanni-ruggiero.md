My first steps in the world of ICT go back to the years of the Commodore 64, my parent's present, not knowing what that gift would have caused.
I learned BASIC from a booklets course bought in a newsstand and the creation of small programs made my days in the small country city
where I grew, until I did the big jump to a PC 386 with no less than 4Mb Ram and 20 Mb hard disk, containing an esoteric internal board called "modem" able to reach the astonishing speed of 14.4 kbps.
Alas, such performance was impossible to reach as there were no local BBS and the intercity calls had prohibitive fares.
SIP, the italian phone company, had a sneaky way to lure me though: ITAPAC (a primitive data connection line)

In this way I joined the world of telematic at the astonishing speed of 2400 baud, mainly to connect to McLink, an historical BBS, of which I am still a customer.

The college turned my passion in a job: while studying in the course of Civil Engineering, PC started to spread as both a tool for CAD and for structural calculation. The latter use attracted my interest, specially the Finite Element Method, which I used to prepare my thesis on plane stresses and to work with a spanish software house to integrate their structural software in Fortran with an external module.

After the college, I split my time between teaching courses for internet users and studying Object Oriented programming, until I won a public competition and started to work at the Ministry of Finance in the Territory Department.

I lasted 20 months.

In 2001 I realized that it was not my cup of tea and quitted to become the head of development in a small software house, whose characteristic was to use Progress, a software platform coming with a proprietary 4GL language.
We developed several projects, of different sizes; likely the most prominent was the sales force automation for the Italian State Monopoly

After a couple of years I left the company to become a consultant. In 2005 I started collaborating with Exprivia, a fairly big software company, inside a small independent group whose main asset was a proprietary NLP engine developed together with Tor Vergata University.
In those years I approached Scala. Its interoperability with Java and the group autonomy allowed me to introduce Scala at work, first in small internal utilities, then in a project (a sensor simulator) for Selex, a big defense contractor.

In 2012 I discovered that in Amsterdam a new startup was launched, Eligotech, with the scope of create products for the Big Data world (topic completely unknown at that time in Italy) using Scala. When I saw their job offering, I decided to try and shortly I found myself immersed in the Nederland climate.
From that day, Hadoop, Spark and alike became my world. We developed Harpoon, a BI product for ingestion and analysis of data from heterogeneous sources, likely one of the first products of that kind in Europe. Later the company merged with a data analysis society and the focus shifted on big data projects for the italian market.

When I had the chance to join the Digital Team, I was excited: having the opportunity to prove that it is indeed possible to change things in Italy for me is priceless.
I don't know what we will be able to achieve with our work, but one day we will be able to say that we have started a new path and when my sons will ask me what I have done to create a better world, I will know what to say.
